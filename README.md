# Convelio Front Interview

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.7.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4800/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Git config

Create a new branch from `master` and call it `convelio-test`.

## Test

- Launch the app in a browser.
- Add an `important` paragraph and a `secondary` paragraph (with lorem ipsum content) to the `HomePage` layout. **Use existing classes**.
- Display order details on the `OrderDetail` page : `number`, `from`, `to`, `price`. **Use existing routing** (you may add logic to it using *existing files*...).
- Write down the CSS classes compiled from `_block.scss`. You can write it in the `BLOCK-CSS-CLASSES.md` file.
- Create the `OrderModel` (in the `models` folder) and type objects where needed.
- Commit your changes and push it on your new branch.

BONUS
- Create two pages : one to display the list of `Drafts` (see `/assets/data.json`), and one to display the details of a specific `Draft`. You may rely on the existing app structure (`services`, `routing`, `modules`, ...).
- Commit your changes and push it on your new branch.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
